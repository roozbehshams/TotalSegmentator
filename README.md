# TotalSegmentator

Tool for segmentation of over 117 classes in CT images. It was trained on a wide range of different CT images (different scanners, institutions, protocols,...) and therefore should work well on most images. A large part of the training dataset can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6802613) (1228 subjects). You can also try the tool online at [totalsegmentator.com](https://totalsegmentator.com/).

**ANNOUNCEMENT: We recently released v2. See [changes and improvements](resources/improvements_in_v2.md).**

Created by the department of [Research and Analysis at University Hospital Basel](https://www.unispital-basel.ch/en/radiologie-nuklearmedizin/forschung-radiologie-nuklearmedizin).  
If you use it please cite our [Radiology AI paper](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryai.230024). Please also cite [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) since TotalSegmentator is heavily based on it.


### Installation

TotalSegmentator works on Ubuntu, Mac and Windows and on CPU and GPU.

Install dependencies:  
* Python >= 3.9
* [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) >= 1.12.1

Optionally:
* if you use the option `--preview` you have to install xvfb (`apt-get install xvfb`)


Install Totalsegmentator
```
pip install TotalSegmentator
```


### Usage
```
TotalSegmentator -i ct.nii.gz -o segmentations
```
> Note: A Nifti file or a folder with all DICOM slices of one patient is allowed as input

> Note: If you run on CPU use the option `--fast` or `--roi_subset` to greatly improve runtime.

> Note: This is not a medical device and not intended for clinical usage.


### Subtasks

![Alt text](resources/imgs/overview_subclasses_2.png)

Next to the default task (`total`) there are more subtasks with more classes:

Openly available for any usage:  
* **total**: default task containing 117 main classes (see [here](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator#class-details) for list of classes)
* **lung_vessels**: lung_vessels (cite [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X22001097)), lung_trachea_bronchia
* **body**: body, body_trunc, body_extremities, skin
* **cerebral_bleed**: intracerebral_hemorrhage (cite [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/7/2631))*
* **hip_implant**: hip_implant*
* **coronary_arteries**: coronary_arteries*
* **pleural_pericard_effusion**: pleural_effusion (cite [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/RLI.0000000000000869)), pericardial_effusion (cite [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics12051045))*

*: These models are not trained on the full totalsegmentator dataset but on some small other datasets. Therefore, expect them to work less robustly.

Available with a license (free licenses available for non-commercial usage [here](https://backend.totalsegmentator.com/license-academic/). For a commercial license contact jakob.wasserthal@usb.ch): 
* **heartchambers_highres**: myocardium, atrium_left, ventricle_left, atrium_right, ventricle_right, aorta, pulmonary_artery (trained on sub-millimeter resolution)
* **appendicular_bones**: patella, tibia, fibula, tarsal, metatarsal, phalanges_feet, ulna, radius, carpal, metacarpal, phalanges_hand
* **tissue_types**: subcutaneous_fat, skeletal_muscle, torso_fat
* **face**: face_region

Usage:
```
TotalSegmentator -i ct.nii.gz -o segmentations -ta <task_name>
```


### Advanced settings
* `--device`: Choose `cpu` or `gpu`
* `--fast`: For faster runtime and less memory requirements use this option. It will run a lower resolution model (3mm instead of 1.5mm). 
* `--roi_subset`: Takes a space separated list of class names (e.g. `spleen colon brain`) and only predicts those classes. Saves a lot of runtime and memory.
* `--preview`: This will generate a 3D rendering of all classes, giving you a quick overview if the segmentation worked and where it failed (see `preview.png` in output directory).
* `--ml`: This will save one nifti file containing all labels instead of one file for each class. Saves runtime during saving of nifti files. (see [here](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator#class-details) for index to class name mapping).
* `--statistics`: This will generate a file `statistics.json` with volume (in mmÂ³) and mean intensity of each class.
* `--radiomics`: This will generate a file `statistics_radiomics.json` with radiomics features of each class. You have to install pyradiomics to use this (`pip install pyradiomics`).


### Run via docker
We also provide a docker container which can be used the following way
```
docker run --gpus 'device=0' --ipc=host -v /absolute/path/to/my/data/directory:/tmp wasserth/totalsegmentator:2.0.0 TotalSegmentator -i /tmp/ct.nii.gz -o /tmp/segmentations
```


### Running v1
If you want to keep on using TotalSegmentator v1 (e.g. because you do not want to change your pipeline) you 
can install it with the following command:
```
pip install TotalSegmentator==1.5.7
```
The documentation for v1 can be found [here](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator/tree/v1.5.7). Bugfixes for v1 are developed in the branch `v1_bugfixes`.
Our Radiology AI publication refers to TotalSegmentator v1. 


### Resource Requirements
Totalsegmentator has the following runtime and memory requirements (using a Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU):  
(1.5mm is the normal model and 3mm is the `--fast` model. With v2 the runtimes have increased a bit since
we added more classes.)

![Alt text](resources/imgs/runtime_table.png)

If you want to reduce memory consumption you can use the following options:
* `--fast`: This will use a lower resolution model
* `--body_seg`: This will crop the image to the body region before processing it
* `--roi_subset <list of classes>`: This will only predict a subset of classes
* `--force_split`: This will split the image into 3 parts and process them one after another
* `--nr_thr_saving 1`: Saving big images with several threads will take a lot of memory


### Train / validation / test split
The exact split of the dataset can be found in the file `meta.csv` inside of the [dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6802613). This was used for the validation in our paper.  
The exact numbers of the results for the high resolution model (1.5mm) can be found [here](resources/results_all_classes_v1.json). The paper shows these numbers in the supplementary materials figure 11. 


### Retrain model and run evaluation
See [here](resources/train_nnunet.md) for more infos how to train a nnU-Net yourself on the TotalSegmentator dataset, how to split the data into train/validation/test set like in our paper and how to run the same evaluation as in our paper.


### Other commands
If you want to combine some subclasses (e.g. lung lobes) into one binary mask (e.g. entire lung) you can use the following command:
```
totalseg_combine_masks -i totalsegmentator_output_dir -o combined_mask.nii.gz -m lung
```

Normally weights are automatically downloaded when running TotalSegmentator. If you want to download the weights with an extra command (e.g. when building a docker container) use this: 
```
totalseg_download_weights -t <task_name>
```

After acquiring a license number for the non-open tasks you can set it with the following command:
```
totalseg_set_license -l aca_12345678910
```

### Python API
You can run totalsegmentator via python:
```python
from totalsegmentator.python_api import totalsegmentator

totalsegmentator(input_path, output_path)
```
You can see all available arguments [here](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator/blob/master/totalsegmentator/python_api.py).


### Install latest master branch (contains latest bug fixes)
```
pip install git+https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator.git
```


### Typical problems
When you get the following error message
```
ITK ERROR: ITK only supports orthonormal direction cosines. No orthonormal definition found!
```
you should do
```
pip install SimpleITK==2.0.2
```


### Other
TotalSegmentator sends anonymous usage statistics to help us improve it further. You can deactivate it by setting `send_usage_stats` to `false` in `~/.totalsegmentator/config.json`.

### Class details

The following table shows a list of all classes.

TA2 is a standardised way to name anatomy. Mostly the TotalSegmentator names follow this standard. 
For some classes they differ which you can see in the table below.

[Here](resources/totalsegmentator_snomed_mapping.csv) you can find a mapping of the TotalSegmentator classes to SNOMED-CT codes.
