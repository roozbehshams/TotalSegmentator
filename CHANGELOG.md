## Master


## Release 2.0.5
* downgrade nnunet to 2.1 to fix bug in `fast` model


## Release 2.0.4
* temporary fix of critical bug in `fast` model. Proper fix in next release.


## LEGACY BUGFIX Release 1.5.7
* download all weights from github releases instead of zenodo


## Release 2.0.3
* fix critical bug in `body` task postprocessing: sometimes all foreground removed


## Release 2.0.2
* allow more than 10 classes in `--roi_subset`
* bugfix in `appendicular_bones` auxiliary mapping
* in multilable output only show classes selected in `--roi_subset` if selected
* make statistics work with dicom input


## Release 2.0.1
* add option `--v1_order` to use the old class order from v1


## Release 2.0.0
* train models with nnU-Net v2 (nnunet_cust dependency no longer needed)
* roi_subset a lot faster, because cropping with 6mm low res model to roi first
* more classes and improved training dataset (for details see `resources/improvements_in_v2.md`)
* bugfix to make cli available on windows
* bugfixes in dicom io
* add `--skip_saving` argument
* automatic tests on windows, linux and mac
* statistics are not calculated anymore for ROIs which are cut off by the top or bottom of the image (use `stats_include_incomplete` to change this behaviour)
* add postprocessing for body segmentation: remove small blobs
* use dicom2nifti for dicom conversion instead of dcm2niix because easier to use across platforms


## Release 1.5.6
* remove verbose print outs not needed
* add helper script for manual setup
* add fast statistics
* download weights from different server for faster and more stable download
* fix `requests` version to avoid `urllib3` openssl error
* minor bugfixes


## Release 1.5.5

* add intracerebral hemorrhage model
* add coronary artery model
* preview file was renamed from `preview.png` to `preview_total.png`
* Split very big images into 3 parts and process one by one to avoid memory problems
* fix: check if input is 4d and then truncate to 3d
* make it work with windows
* make it work with cpu


## Release 1.3
